# Dog Breed Classification (TensorFlow)

This programme builds and trains a deep learning model to identify the breed of a dog using TensorFlow. This includes:
- Code to explore and clean data using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Training and testing a machine learning model using TensorFlow on Google Colab leveraging a GPU
- Exporting the machine learning model for re-use elsewhere
